Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = Object.create(require('core-util-is'));\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction afterTransform(er, data) {\n  var ts = this._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) {\n    return this.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\n  }\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data != null) // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\n    this.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = this._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = {\n    afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\n    needTransform: false,\n    transforming: false,\n    writecb: null,\n    writechunk: null,\n    writeencoding: null\n  };\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\n}\n\nfunction prefinish() {\n  var _this = this;\n\n  if (typeof this._flush === 'function') {\n    this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(_this, er, data);\n    });\n  } else {\n    done(this, null, null);\n  }\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

Dependent\n     * tasks are specified as parameters to the function, after the usual callback\n     * parameter, with the parameter names matching the names of the tasks it\n     * depends on. This can provide even more readable task graphs which can be\n     * easier to maintain.\n     *\n     * If a final callback is specified, the task results are similarly injected,\n     * specified as named parameters after the initial error parameter.\n     *\n     * The autoInject function is purely syntactic sugar and its semantics are\n     * otherwise equivalent to [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}.\n     *\n     * @name autoInject\n     * @static\n     * @memberOf module:ControlFlow\n     * @method\n     * @see [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}\n     * @category Control Flow\n     * @param {Object} tasks - An object, each of whose properties is an {@link AsyncFunction} of\n     * the form 'func([dependencies...], callback). The object's key of a property\n     * serves as the name of the task defined by that property, i.e. can be used\n     * when specifying requirements for other tasks.\n     * * The `callback` parameter is a `callback(err, result)` which must be called\n     *   when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of\n     *   the function's execution. The remaining parameters name other tasks on\n     *   which the task is dependent, and the results from those tasks are the\n     *   arguments of those parameters.\n     * @param {Function} [callback] - An optional callback which is called when all\n     * the tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks`\n     * pass an error to their callback, and a `results` object with any completed\n     * task results, similar to `auto`.\n     * @returns {Promise} a promise, if no callback is passed\n     * @example\n     *\n     * //  The example from `auto` can be rewritten as follows:\n     * async.autoInject({\n     *     get_data: function(callback) {\n     *         // async code to get some data\n     *         callback(null, 'data', 'converted to array');\n     *     },\n     *     make_folder: function(callback) {\n     *         // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n     *         // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n     *         callback(null, 'folder');\n     *     },\n     *     write_file: function(get_data, make_folder, callback) {\n     *         // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n     *         // write the data to a file in the directory\n     *         callback(null, 'filename');\n     *     },\n     *     email_link: function(write_file, callback) {\n     *         // once the file is written let's email a link to it...\n     *         // write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n     *         callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'});\n     *     }\n     * }, function(err, results) {\n     *     console.log('err = ', err);\n     *     console.log('email_link = ', results.email_link);\n     * });\n     *\n     * // If you are using a JS minifier that mangles parameter names, `autoInject`\n     * // will not work with plain functions, since the parameter names will be\n     * // collapsed to a single letter identifier.

working directory. Checks if path is absolute or\n * relative. If the path is relative, this function checks if the path is\n * relative to symlink or relative to current working directory. This is an\n * initiative to find a smarter `srcpath` to supply when building symlinks.\n * This allows you to determine which path to use out of one of three possible\n * types of source paths. The first is an absolute path. This is detected by\n * `path.isAbsolute()`. When an absolute path is provided, it is checked to\n * see if it exists. If it does it's used, if not an error is returned\n * (callback)/ thrown (sync). The other two options for `srcpath` are a\n * relative url. By default Node's `fs.symlink` works by creating a symlink\n * using `dstpath` and expects the `srcpath` to be relative to the newly\n * created symlink. If you provide a `srcpath` that does not exist on the file\n * system it results in a broken symlink. To minimize this, the function\n * checks to see if the 'relative to symlink' source file exists, and if it\n * does it will use it. If it does not, it checks if there's a file that\n * exists that is relative to the current working directory, if does its used.\n * This preserves the expectations of the original fs.symlink spec and adds\n * the ability to pass in `relative to current working direcotry` paths.\n */\n\nfunction symlinkPaths (srcpath, dstpath, callback) {\n  if (path.isAbsolute(srcpath)) {\n    return fs.lstat(srcpath, (err) => {\n      if (err) {\n        err.message = err.message.replace('lstat', 'ensureSymlink')\n        return callback(err)\n      }\n      return callback(null, {\n        toCwd: srcpath,\n        toDst: srcpath\n      })\n    })\n  } else {\n    const dstdir = path.dirname(dstpath)\n    const relativeToDst = path.join(dstdir, srcpath)\n    return pathExists(relativeToDst, (err, exists) => {\n      if (err) return callback(err)\n      if (exists) {\n        return callback(null, {\n          toCwd: relativeToDst,\n          toDst: srcpath\n        })\n      } else {\n        return fs.lstat(srcpath, (err) => {\n          if (err) {\n            err.message = err.message.replace('lstat', 'ensureSymlink')\n            return callback(err)\n          }\n          return callback(null, {\n            toCwd: srcpath,\n            toDst: path.relative(dstdir, srcpath)\n          })\n        })\n      }\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nfunction symlinkPathsSync (srcpath, dstpath) {\n  let exists\n  if (path.isAbsolute(srcpath)) {\n    exists = fs.existsSync(srcpath)\n    if (!exists) throw new Error('absolute srcpath does not exist')\n    return {\n      toCwd: srcpath,\n      toDst: srcpath\n    }\n  } else {\n    const dstdir = path.dirname(dstpath)\n    const relativeToDst = path.join(dstdir, srcpath)\n    exists = fs.existsSync(relativeToDst)\n    if (exists) {\n      return {\n        toCwd: relativeToDst,\n        toDst: srcpath\n      }\n    } else {\n      exists = fs.existsSync(srcpath)\n      if (!exists) throw new Error('relative srcpath does not exist')\n      return {\n        toCwd: srcpath,\n        toDst: path.relative(dstdir, srcpath)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  symlinkPaths,\n  symlinkPathsSync\n}\n","'use strict'\n\nconst fs = require('graceful-fs')\n\nfunction symlinkType (srcpath, type, callback) {\n  callback = (typeof type === 'function') ? type : callback\n  type = (typeof type === 'function') ? false : type\n  if (type) return callback(null, type)\n  fs.lstat(srcpath, (err, stats) => {\n    if (err) return callback(null, 'file')\n    type = (stats && stats.isDirectory()) ?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.
